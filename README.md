Is there a clear call-to-action button for others to quickly learn about you?
Is there any confusing part in the website layout?
Is your copy too wordy?
Does the site take a long time to load? Slow loading time is equivalent to being late for an interview and should be avoided by all means.
Does the webpage show the core issues that users care about, or is it just a collection of unorganized achievements meaningless to the user?
Can the webpage be loaded and displayed normally on mobile?
